# Quarterly Meta Loop Prompt

Review the last 90 days from a systems perspective.

1. Which parts of the pillar model are over-complicated?
2. Which automations should be promoted, merged, or removed?
3. Where are the biggest failure modes (missed reminders, stale projects, noisy prompts)?
4. Propose strategic updates and migration steps.
