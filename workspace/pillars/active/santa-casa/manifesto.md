mission: Santa casa is a Catholic homeschooling coop program started by my wife Stephanie
  Nazareth and myself. It's based in Goa and regular days are every Wednesday.
scope: 'This Sankalpa is a co-op that doesn''t tackle main subjects like math, science,
  and English. Instead, it covers extra areas: because it is Catholic, we have faith-related
  topics, physical education, and occasional masses. A lot of the discussions involve
  decisions to be made and activities we''re conducting, such as: 1. Outreach programs
  2. Regular Wednesday planning 3. Sensitive issues 4. Lesson planning. There could
  also be projects about various subjects we might be teaching, perhaps on a semester-based
  schedule. Those are the types of projects we work on. Regarding what it is not about:
  I don''t really have anything specific to exclude. It could involve any of these
  things. If there is anything it''s not about, I will mention that.'
non_negotiables:
- Document non-negotiable principles.
success_signals:
- One of the things we should see is families continuing and not dropping out
- which has been good for the most part so far. We might even see those numbers increasing
  a bit. We should also see progress with the kids. For example
- last year we did a play
- and this year we are thinking of maybe even doing a musical. In terms of talent
- they are doing better than before. At Mass
- 'we are also trying to get them to: 1. Be part of the choir 2. Improve their altar
  serving 3. Sing with their voices. It is about adding a layer of improvement every
  year. Those are some of the measurable success indicators.'
