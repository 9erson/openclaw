Onboarding captured `mission`:

Santa casa is a Catholic homeschooling coop program started by my wife Stephanie Nazareth and myself. It's based in Goa and regular days are every Wednesday.

Onboarding captured `scope`:

This Sankalpa is a co-op that doesn't tackle main subjects like math, science, and English. Instead, it covers extra areas: because it is Catholic, we have faith-related topics, physical education, and occasional masses. A lot of the discussions involve decisions to be made and activities we're conducting, such as: 1. Outreach programs 2. Regular Wednesday planning 3. Sensitive issues 4. Lesson planning. There could also be projects about various subjects we might be teaching, perhaps on a semester-based schedule. Those are the types of projects we work on. Regarding what it is not about: I don't really have anything specific to exclude. It could involve any of these things. If there is anything it's not about, I will mention that.

Onboarding captured `success_signals`:

- One of the things we should see is families continuing and not dropping out
- which has been good for the most part so far. We might even see those numbers increasing a bit. We should also see progress with the kids. For example
- last year we did a play
- and this year we are thinking of maybe even doing a musical. In terms of talent
- they are doing better than before. At Mass
- we are also trying to get them to: 1. Be part of the choir 2. Improve their altar serving 3. Sing with their voices. It is about adding a layer of improvement every year. Those are some of the measurable success indicators.
