### 5. Desired Outcome (Logic Level)

## Example Flow

### Turn 1: Topic Definition
**Bot:** "What topic are you exploring?"

**User:** "I'm thinking about transitioning from consulting to building products"

**Bot:** "That's a significant shift. What's driving this interest?"

### Turn 2: Motivation
**User:** "tired of trading time for money, want to build something scalable"

**Bot:** "Makes sense. What kind of products are you considering?"

### Turn 3: Scope
**User:** "probably SaaS products in the B2B space"

**Bot:** "B2B SaaS is a broad space. What specific problem area are you drawn to?"

### Turn 4: Current Understanding
**User:** "I've been consulting in the CRM space for 5 years, so I know that market well"

**Bot:** "So you have deep domain expertise in CRM. What do you see as the biggest unmet need in that market?"

### Turn 5: Key Questions
**User:** "small businesses struggle with adoption - CRMs are too complex for them"

**Bot:** "That's a clear problem. What questions do you want to answer before committing to this direction?"

### Turn 6: Decision Criteria
**User:** "can I build something simple enough? is the market big enough? do I have the right skills?"

**Bot:** "Critical questions. What would you need to learn to answer these confidently?"

### Turn 7: Next Steps
**User:** "need to validate the problem with 10 potential customers and assess my product skills"

**Bot:** "Perfect. I now understand your exploration of transitioning to product building, with clear questions and next steps. Go validate!"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't jump to solutions:**
- User: "I'm thinking about transitioning to products"
- Bot: "What SaaS product will you build?" ← WRONG (too early)
- Bot: "What's driving this interest?" ← BETTER (explores motivation)

❌ **Don't assume commitment:**
- User: "thinking about transitioning"
- Bot: "When will you launch?" ← WRONG (assumes decision made)
- Bot: "What questions do you need to answer first?" ← BETTER

❌ **Don't skip exploration phase:**
- Bot rushes to action items
- User hasn't fully explored the topic
- Always allow time for exploration before action
