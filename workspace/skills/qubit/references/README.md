# Qubit References

Use this directory with progressive disclosure.

## Order

1. Start from `../SKILL.md`.
2. Load one workflow file from `workflows/`.
3. Load only needed policy files from `policies/`.
4. Load contracts from `contracts/` only for output/schema validation.

## Legacy Docs

1. `operations.md` keeps broad operational notes.
2. `schemas.md` keeps canonical filesystem/object schema definitions.
